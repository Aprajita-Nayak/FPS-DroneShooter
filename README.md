# FPS Drone Shooter ‚Äì Unreal Engine C++ Project

## üéØ Overview

This project is a basic First-Person Shooter game made in Unreal Engine using C++. The player can shoot at moving drone targets that react to damage and are destroyed upon impact. Each destroyed drone adds to the player's score.

Due to limited time, the online JSON integration and dynamic box spawning were not implemented. However, the project demonstrates:
- Shooting mechanics using line trace
- Damage and destruction logic
- Score system updated via UI
- C++ class structure with clean formatting
